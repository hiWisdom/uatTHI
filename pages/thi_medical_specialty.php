Gastroenterologists can treat everything from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to hepatitis C. Here’s a look at what these specialists do and when you should consider seeing one.

                                                    After you complete your residency, you must complete a 2- or 3-year fellowship to receive more specialized training in this field. This includes training in endoscopy, which is a nonsurgical procedure doctors use to examine the GI tract.

                                                <p>
                                                    Once you’ve completed your training, you must pass a specialty certification exam for gastroenterologists. The American Board of Internal Medicine certifies you upon successful completion of the exam.

Gastroenterologists can treat everything from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to hepatitis C. Here’s a look at what these specialists do and when you should consider seeing one.

                                                    After you complete your residency, you must complete a 2- or 3-year fellowship to receive more specialized training in this field. This includes training in endoscopy, which is a nonsurgical procedure doctors use to examine the GI tract.

Gastroenterologists can treat everything from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to hepatitis C. Here’s a look at what these specialists do and when you should consider seeing one.

                                                    Gastroenterologists primarily diagnose and treat GI conditions. If your primary care physician has noticed an issue involving your GI tract, they will most likely recommend you see a gastroenterologist for a more detailed assessment of the issue.

                                                    Gastroenterologists perform endoscopic procedures, in which they use specialized instruments to view the GI tract and make a diagnosis.

                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>a. 4-year college degree.</li>
                                                    <li>a. 4 years of medical school.</li>
                                                    <li>a. 3-year training program, called a residency, in internal medicine, which includes work alongside experienced gastroenterologists and professional mentorship.</li>
                                                </ul>

                                                <p>
                                                    After you complete your residency, you must complete a 2- or 3-year fellowship to receive more specialized training in this field. This includes training in endoscopy, which is a nonsurgical procedure doctors use to examine the GI tract.
                                                    
                                                </p>

                                                    Gastroenterology is an area of medicine that focuses on the health of the digestive system, or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, as well as the liver. Gastroenterologists can treat everything from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to hepatitis C. Here’s a look at what these specialists do and when you should consider seeing one.

                                                    Gastroenterologists primarily diagnose and treat GI conditions. If your primary care physician has noticed an issue involving your GI tract, they will most likely recommend you see a gastroenterologist for a more detailed assessment of the issue.

                                                    Gastroenterologists perform endoscopic procedures, in which they use specialized instruments to view the GI tract and make a diagnosis.

                                                    <li>a. 3-year training program, called a residency, in internal medicine, which includes work alongside experienced gastroenterologists and professional mentorship.</li>

                                                    After you complete your residency, you must complete a 2- or 3-year fellowship to receive more specialized training in this field. This includes training in endoscopy, which is a nonsurgical procedure doctors use to examine the GI tract.

                                                    Once you’ve completed your training, you must pass a specialty certification exam for gastroenterologists. The American Board of Internal Medicine certifies you upon successful completion of the exam.

                                                    Gastroenterology is an area of medicine that focuses on the health of the digestive system, or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, as well as the liver. Gastroenterologists can treat everything from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to hepatitis C. Here’s a look at what these specialists do and when you should consider seeing one.

                                                    After you complete your residency, you must complete a 2- or 3-year fellowship to receive more specialized training in this field. This includes training in endoscopy, which is a nonsurgical procedure doctors use to examine the GI tract.

Gastroenterologists can treat everything from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to hepatitis C. Here’s a look at what these specialists do and when you should consider seeing one.

                                                    Gastroenterologists perform endoscopic procedures, in which they use specialized instruments to view the GI tract and make a diagnosis.

                                                    <li>a. 3-year training program, called a residency, in internal medicine, which includes work alongside experienced gastroenterologists and professional mentorship.</li>

                                                    After you complete your residency, you must complete a 2- or 3-year fellowship to receive more specialized training in this field. This includes training in endoscopy, which is a nonsurgical procedure doctors use to examine the GI tract.

                                                    Once you’ve completed your training, you must pass a specialty certification exam for gastroenterologists. The American Board of Internal Medicine certifies you upon successful completion of the exam.

Gastroenterologists can treat everything from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to hepatitis C. Here’s a look at what these specialists do and when you should consider seeing one.

                                                    After you complete your residency, you must complete a 2- or 3-year fellowship to receive more specialized training in this field. This includes training in endoscopy, which is a nonsurgical procedure doctors use to examine the GI tract.

                                                    Gastroenterology is an area of medicine that focuses on the health of the digestive system, or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, as well as the liver. Gastroenterologists can treat everything from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to hepatitis C. Here’s a look at what these specialists do and when you should consider seeing one.

                                                <p>
                                                    After you complete your residency, you must complete a 2- or 3-year fellowship to receive more specialized training in this field. This includes training in endoscopy, which is a nonsurgical procedure doctors use to examine the GI tract.

                                                    Once you’ve completed your training, you must pass a specialty certification exam for gastroenterologists. The American Board of Internal Medicine certifies you upon successful completion of the exam.

                                                    Gastroenterology is an area of medicine that focuses on the health of the digestive system, or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, as well as the liver. Gastroenterologists can treat everything from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to hepatitis C. Here’s a look at what these specialists do and when you should consider seeing one.

                                                    Gastroenterologists primarily diagnose and treat GI conditions. If your primary care physician has noticed an issue involving your GI tract, they will most likely recommend you see a gastroenterologist for a more detailed assessment of the issue.

                                                    Gastroenterologists perform endoscopic procedures, in which they use specialized instruments to view the GI tract and make a diagnosis.

                                                <ul>

                                                    <li>a. 3-year training program, called a residency, in internal medicine, which includes work alongside experienced gastroenterologists and professional mentorship.</li>

                                                    After you complete your residency, you must complete a 2- or 3-year fellowship to receive more specialized training in this field. This includes training in endoscopy, which is a nonsurgical procedure doctors use to examine the GI tract.

                                                    Once you’ve completed your training, you must pass a specialty certification exam for gastroenterologists. The American Board of Internal Medicine certifies you upon successful completion of the exam.
